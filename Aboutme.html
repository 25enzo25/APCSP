<h1>Enzos website</h1>
<p>welcome to my site</p>
<p class="writing2"> I attended piedmont high school. And plan to attend this high school for the next 4 years. Even though books are my least favorite thing to do I still believe it's a good idea to put them on here. And friends. Friends are a huge part of learning and they are a huge part of highschool.
<p class="writing"> I am Enzo Bernales. I am a soccer player and student at Piedmont High School. I am a mix of Peruvian and Brazilian. My three passions are sports, eating, and music. In the future, I wish to play professional soccer.</p>
